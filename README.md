# TODO

- Update all copy/images to what's in the final PDF, and adjust the order/placement of stories (some switched sections)
- All images look very pixelated—update, please!
- Homepage changes
  - Need a place in the nav or in the footer to download the PDF
- Innovation changes
  - Stories should be in the same order as in the book unless there's some reason not to (thinking perhaps this was the order previously)
  - Need a photo for Inspiring New Hope
- Research changes
  - Update image for Giving a Fair Chance (you'll need to find one—but preferably not callinig one of our student musicians a criminal)
- Leadership changes
  - Move "University Administration" down a line and make a header with line underneath
  - Is it possible to make this nav item "University Leadership"? I feel like it kinda runs together with the other section headers—like, it appears like leadership would be a category of stories we're talking about. Or maybe there's a nav item we use for all of the back of the book stuff and make the back-of-book pages part of a dropdown?
- President's Letter changes
  - Is there room in the nav (i'm guessing no) to make this "Interim President's Letter"?
  - Photo of Scott is broken (and alt text has his name misspelled)
- Financials changes
  - These aren't just financials—we either need to split this into two pages (which would still require changing the nav I guess) or change the nav; last year we used "Financials & Numbers"
  - The very bold numbers on the Degrees & Campus Statistics are SUPER hard to read. Can we increase the font size or decrease the font weight?
  - Put the two degrees sections either in the same row or the same column
